    {
      "title": "Article 2: Legal status of the territorial sea, of the air space over the territorial sea and of its bed and subsoil",
      "explanation": "This article establishes the legal framework for a coastal state's sovereignty over its territorial sea:\n\n• Sovereignty Extends to the Sea: Coastal states have complete sovereignty over their territorial sea, which includes the waters, airspace above, and the seabed and subsoil below. This means they have the authority to enforce laws, regulate resources, and control access within this zone.\n\n• Subject to International Law: This sovereignty is not absolute. It must be exercised in accordance with the broader rules of international law and the specific provisions of UNCLOS.\n\n• Right of Innocent Passage: Despite this sovereignty, foreign ships have the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea, meaning they can transit without interference, as long as they do not threaten the peace, security, or order of the coastal state."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 3: Breadth of the territorial sea",
      "explanation": "This article defines the maximum breadth of a coastal state's territorial sea:\n\n• Breadth of the Territorial Sea: Coastal states can claim territorial sea up to 12 nautical miles from their baseline, usually defined by the low-water line along the coast as officially recognized by the state.\n\n• Maximum Limit: This 12-nautical-mile limit establishes the maximum distance for full sovereignty over the adjacent sea area, including the waters, seabed, subsoil, and airspace above."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 4: Outer limit of the territorial sea",
      "explanation": "This article defines the method for determining the outer limit of a coastal state's territorial sea:\n\n• Measurement Method: The outer limit of the territorial sea is measured from the baseline, which is typically the low-water line along the coast, as officially recognized by the coastal state. This baseline may include straight baselines, normal baselines, or baselines around fringing reefs, depending on the geographic features of the coastline.\n\n• Maximum Extent: The territorial sea extends up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline, as specified in Article 3. This distance can only be modified through international agreements or special arrangements between states.\n\n• Charting and Publication: Coastal states must clearly mark and publish these outer limits on charts or lists of geographical coordinates to ensure transparency and consistency in maritime boundary claims. These charts or coordinates must be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations to ensure international recognition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 5: Normal baseline",
      "explanation": "This article defines the standard method for determining the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured:\n\n• Normal Baseline Definition: The normal baseline is the low-water line along the coast, as shown on officially recognized charts by the coastal state. This line represents the average position of the low tide, providing a stable reference for defining maritime boundaries.\n\n• Importance for Consistency: Using the low-water line ensures a consistent and widely accepted basis for defining the extent of the territorial sea, reducing potential disputes over boundary definitions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 6: Reefs",
      "explanation": "This article provides special baseline rules for islands situated on atolls or islands with fringing reefs:\n\n• Reef Baseline Concept: For islands surrounded by fringing reefs or those forming atolls, the baseline for measuring the territorial sea is not the regular low-water line along the coast. Instead, it is the seaward low-water line of the reef itself, as shown on charts officially recognized by the coastal state.\n\n• Special Considerations: This method accounts for the fact that the visible landmass may be significantly inland from the outer edge of the reef. It also recognizes the natural barrier function of reefs in protecting the coastal environment and shaping territorial boundaries.\n\n• Official Charting: These baselines must be clearly marked on officially recognized charts to ensure consistency in maritime boundary measurements and avoid disputes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 7: Straight baselines",
      "explanation": "This article establishes the rules for using straight baselines to measure the breadth of the territorial sea in specific geographic situations:\n\n• When to Use Straight Baselines: Applicable where the coastline is deeply indented or cut into, or where there is a fringe of islands along the coast, creating a naturally enclosed sea. Suitable in regions with complex coastal formations where the normal low-water line is impractical.\n\n• Conditions for Drawing Straight Baselines: Must connect appropriate points on the coast, should not depart significantly from the general direction of the coast, cannot be used in a way that cuts off the territorial sea of another state from the high seas or an exclusive economic zone, and must consider the long-established economic interests of the region, which are clearly defined and historically recognized.\n\n• Official Documentation: These baselines must be clearly marked on charts officially recognized by the coastal state to avoid disputes and ensure transparency."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 8: Internal waters",
      "explanation": "This article defines internal waters, which are the waters on the landward side of the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured:\n\n• Definition of Internal Waters: These waters include ports, harbors, rivers, bays, and coastal lagoons. Internal waters are considered to be an integral part of the sovereign territory of the coastal state.\n\n• Sovereignty and Jurisdiction: The coastal state has full sovereignty over its internal waters, just like its land territory. This includes the authority to enforce laws, regulate resources, and control access without interference from other states.\n\n• Impact of Straight Baselines: If straight baselines are used to measure the territorial sea, any waters enclosed by these baselines also become internal waters, even if they were previously considered part of the territorial sea or high seas.\n\n• Right of Innocent Passage: Unlike the territorial sea, foreign vessels generally have no right of innocent passage in internal waters unless specifically granted by the coastal state."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 9: Mouths of rivers",
      "explanation": "This article specifies how to determine the baseline for measuring the territorial sea at the mouths of rivers:\n\n• Baseline Across River Mouths: If a river flows directly into the sea, the baseline is a straight line drawn across the mouth of the river between the low-water line on either side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 10: Bays",
      "explanation": "This article defines how to identify bays and establish baselines across their mouths:\n\n• What Qualifies as a Bay: A well-marked indentation that is more than just a simple curve of the coastline. Its area must be at least as large as a semicircle with a diameter equal to the length of the line drawn across its mouth.\n\n• Drawing Baselines Across Bays: If the distance between the natural entrance points of a bay is 24 nautical miles or less, a straight baseline can be drawn between these points. Waters enclosed by this baseline are considered internal waters.\n\n• Special Cases and Exclusions: This article does not apply to indentations created by river mouths, fjords, or other narrow inlets. Historic bays, which have long-standing recognition under international law, may follow different rules."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 11: Ports",
      "explanation": "This article defines how ports are considered when measuring the breadth of the territorial sea:\n\n• Permanent Harbor Works: Structures like docks, breakwaters, jetties, and piers that form an integral part of a port are considered part of the coastline. These structures are included when drawing the baseline for the territorial sea.\n\n• Exclusions: Offshore installations and artificial islands that are separate from the main harbor are not included as part of the baseline."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 12: Roadsteads",
      "explanation": "This article defines how roadsteads are treated in relation to territorial seas:\n\n• Definition of Roadsteads: Roadsteads are sheltered areas outside the main harbor where ships can anchor safely. They are often used when a harbor is too congested, too shallow, or when vessels need to wait for clearance.\n\n• Inclusion in Territorial Sea: Roadsteads that are clearly identified and normally used for the loading, unloading, and anchoring of ships are considered part of the territorial sea, even if they lie beyond the baseline."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 13: Low-tide elevations",
      "explanation": "This article defines how low-tide elevations are treated in relation to the territorial sea:\n\n• Definition of Low-Tide Elevations: These are naturally formed areas of land that are surrounded by water and exposed at low tide but covered at high tide. Unlike islands, they do not remain above water at all times.\n\n• Impact on Territorial Sea Baselines: If a low-tide elevation is located within the territorial sea (less than 12 nautical miles from the coast or a recognized baseline), it can be used as a baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea. If it is located beyond the territorial sea, it cannot be used as a baseline for territorial sea measurements."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 14: Combination of methods for determining baselines",
      "explanation": "This article allows coastal states to use a combination of different methods for determining baselines, depending on the geographic and physical conditions of their coastlines:\n\n• Flexible Approach: Coastal states can apply different baseline methods as outlined in the previous articles, such as straight baselines, normal baselines, and reef baselines, based on the specific features of their coastline.\n\n• Adaptation to Local Conditions: This flexibility allows coastal states to account for diverse coastal formations like fringing reefs, fjords, deeply indented coasts, and river mouths, ensuring accurate and practical baseline measurements."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 15: Delimitation of the territorial sea between States with opposite or adjacent coasts",
      "explanation": "This article provides guidelines for defining the territorial sea boundaries between coastal states that have opposite or adjacent coastlines:\n\n• Equidistance Principle: In the absence of a specific agreement, the boundary should be the median line (equidistant line) between the nearest points of the baselines of the two states. This line is drawn so that each point is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines of both states.\n\n• Exceptions: This rule does not apply if there is a historic title or other special circumstances that justify a different boundary, or if the states involved have mutually agreed on a different method for delimiting their territorial seas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Article 16: Charts and lists of geographical coordinates",
      "explanation": "This article outlines the requirements for publishing and communicating the baselines and outer limits of the territorial sea:\n\n• Official Charts and Coordinates: Coastal states must clearly indicate their baselines and the outer limits of their territorial sea on official nautical charts. Alternatively, these limits can be described in lists of geographical coordinates with precise latitude and longitude.\n\n• Communication with the United Nations: Coastal states must deposit these charts or lists with the Secretary-General of the United Nations to ensure international recognition and transparency."
